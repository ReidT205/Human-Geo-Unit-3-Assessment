            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <p>My investigation into cultural appropriation in fashion uncovered a power imbalance: dominant fashion industries, often Western brands, profit by exploiting the cultural symbols of marginalized communities, frequently erasing their original meanings in the process. This ties directly to the essential question, "<b>Who gets to define a culture?</b>", as these brands reshape cultural narratives for commercial gain, sidelining the communities who created them. Evidence from cases like the Navajo Nation’s legal battle with Urban Outfitters highlights how sacred symbols are turned into trendy products without consent. Additionally, "How does globalization change cultures?" is answered through the commodification of local traits—such as African wax prints or Indigenous patterns—which globalization spreads worldwide, often stripping them of context and reinventing them as marketable goods. This dual process of erasure and reinvention challenges cultural authenticity while exposing ethical tensions in the fashion industry.</p>

            <h2>Reflection: Who Owns Culture?</h2>
            <p>This case study taught me that cultural ownership is a contested and complex issue. Fashion reveals a tension between cultural exchange and exploitation: while cultures naturally evolve and blend, appropriation often harms when it ignores the original context and benefits the powerful. I learned that defining a culture isn’t just about heritage—it’s about who holds the power to represent it. For example, when a luxury brand uses a traditional design without crediting its source, it claims ownership in a way that silences the originating community. This research uncovered how deeply power dynamics and globalization shape these interactions, leaving me questioning how we can honor cultural heritage without turning it into a commodity.</p>

                <h3>Cultural ownership is complex</h3>
                <p>The complexity of cultural ownership became clear through this case study. In fashion, cultural elements—like a Native American headdress or a Maasai beaded pattern—are fluid, shared across time and borders, yet appropriation often reduces them to superficial trends. For instance, a headdress, sacred to its community, becomes a festival accessory, losing its spiritual meaning. While cultural exchange can enrich, appropriation crosses into harm when it disregards context and exploits without permission. This fluidity makes ownership hard to pin down, but the harm is undeniable when marginalized voices are excluded from the conversation.</p>

                <h3>Power dynamics influence appropriation</h3>
                <p>Power imbalances are at the heart of cultural appropriation in fashion. Western brands, with their economic and cultural dominance, can freely use marginalized cultures’ symbols—think Victoria’s Secret’s use of Native-inspired designs—while the originating communities lack the resources to resist or profit. This shapes <b>who gets to use cultural elements</b> and <b>who benefits</b>, as profits flow to corporations rather than artisans or cultural stewards. The fashion industry’s global influence amplifies this, dictating trends while rarely facing accountability, leaving marginalized groups without control over their own heritage.</p>

                <h3>Globalization's double-edged impact</h3>
                <p>Globalization’s impact on cultures, as seen in fashion, is both destructive and transformative. It can erase cultural meanings by commodifying symbols—like turning an Indigenous pattern into a mass-produced T-shirt—stripping them of significance for profit. Yet it also <b>reinvents</b> cultures, blending traditions into hybrid forms, such as fusion designs that mix global influences. However, this reinvention often serves the industry more than the communities, as seen when fast fashion brands profit while original meanings fade. Answering "<b>How does globalization change cultures?</b>", I see it as a double-edged sword: it amplifies visibility but risks diluting authenticity, leaving cultures vulnerable to exploitation.</p>

        <section class="future-considerations">
            <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
            <p>The fashion industry can move forward by engaging diverse cultures respectfully rather than appropriating them. One solution is collaboration: brands could partner with artisans and designers from the cultures they draw from, ensuring credit and compensation—imagine Indigenous creators co-designing with brands like Urban Outfitters. Another step is <b>education</b>, teaching consumers and companies about the cultural significance of designs to foster appreciation over exploitation. Legal protections, like intellectual property rights for cultural heritage, could also empower communities to safeguard their symbols. By shifting from extraction to equity, the industry can honor diverse cultures while reducing harm.</p>
