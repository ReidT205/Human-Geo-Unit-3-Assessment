            <h2>Who gets to define a culture?</h2>
            <p>In the context of cultural appropriation in fashion, the question of who gets to define a culture often reveals a power imbalance between dominant fashion industries and marginalized cultural communities. Fashion brands, designers, and corporations—typically from Western, economically dominant regions—frequently control how cultural symbols are used and interpreted, reshaping the <b>cultural landscape</b> in ways that prioritize profit over authenticity. For example, when a high-end designer incorporates a <b>cultural trait</b> like a traditional Navajo pattern into a collection, they redefine its meaning for a global audience, often stripping it of its original significance. This act marginalizes the ethnicity of the Navajo people, whose voices are rarely included in the narrative of their own culture’s representation. The cultural landscape of fashion thus becomes a space where dominant groups dictate cultural definitions, raising ethical concerns about ownership and respect.</p>

                    <dd>In fashion appropriation, the cultural landscape is altered as traditional symbols are commodified and displayed in global fashion hubs like Paris or New York, far from their origins. This shift changes how cultures are perceived and valued, often reducing them to aesthetic trends.</dd>

                    <dd>Specific cultural traits, such as Indigenous textile patterns or sacred headdresses, are selectively borrowed by fashion brands. These traits are often misrepresented or oversimplified, losing their cultural depth in the process.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Ethnicity</dt>

            <h2>How does globalization change cultures?</h2>
            <p>Globalization profoundly changes cultures by commodifying and spreading <b>cultural traits</b> through transnational networks, often via <b>diaspora</b> communities or global media. In fashion, this means that a traditional design from a small Indigenous community can be replicated, mass-produced, and sold worldwide, detached from its original context. For instance, African wax prints, once tied to specific cultural stories, are now globally recognized fashion staples, their meanings reinvented for diverse audiences. This process can erase cultural significance, as seen when sacred symbols are reduced to trendy prints. However, it can also reinvent cultures, creating hybrid styles that blend traditions. The use of <b>toponyms</b> in branding—such as naming a product line “Navajo” without permission—further illustrates how globalization distorts cultural identities for commercial gain. Ultimately, globalization commodifies culture, challenging its authenticity while expanding its reach.</p>

                    <dd>Diaspora communities often serve as conduits for cultural diffusion, as their traditions are adapted or appropriated by global fashion.

            <h2>Materialism Theory Application</h2>
            <p>Materialism Theory, which examines how material goods represent cultural expression and reveal power dynamics, is crucial for understanding cultural appropriation in fashion. Fashion items, as material objects, embody cultural meanings that are often controlled by dominant groups. For instance, a sacred headdress transformed into a runway accessory loses its spiritual significance, becoming a commodity that reflects the power of the fashion industry to redefine culture. This commodification exposes deep-seated power disparities: while brands profit from cultural symbols, the originating communities are rarely compensated or credited. Furthermore, globalization accelerates this transformation, turning cultural objects into mass-produced goods that are sold worldwide, often erasing their original context. Materialism highlights how fashion appropriation is not just about aesthetics but about control over cultural narratives and economic gain.</p>

                <h3>Key Insights from Materialism Theory</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fashion items, like clothing and accessories, embody cultural meanings that are redefined by those who control their production and sale, often marginalizing the original creators.</li>
                    <li>Power dynamics are revealed as dominant fashion brands profit from cultural symbols while excluding the communities that created them, reinforcing economic and cultural inequalities.</li>
                    <li>Globalization transforms cultural objects into commodities, spreading them globally but often erasing their original significance, as sacred or traditional items become mere fashion statements.</li>
