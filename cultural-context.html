            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Cultural appropriation in fashion happens when elements of one culture—such as clothing, patterns, or symbols—are adopted by individuals or brands from another culture, typically a dominant one, without permission, understanding, or respect for their original meaning. In the fashion industry, this often manifests through the use of traditional designs (e.g., Indigenous patterns), sacred symbols (e.g., religious motifs), or culturally significant garments (e.g., Native American headdresses) as trendy accessories, runway pieces, or mass-produced items. For example, a fashion brand might replicate a traditional Navajo textile pattern for a jacket without acknowledging its cultural roots or compensating the community.</p>
            <p>This issue is significant because it highlights unequal power dynamics: marginalized cultures are often exploited by dominant ones for profit or aesthetics, raising questions about <b>who gets to define a culture</b>. It also ties into how <b>globalization changes cultures</b>, as cultural elements are stripped of their context and commodified for global markets, often erasing their original significance. Examining cultural appropriation in fashion reveals broader tensions around identity, ownership, and respect in a connected world.</p>

        <section class="context-history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The fashion industry has a long history of borrowing from diverse cultures, often sparking controversy. In the 1960s and 1970s, the bohemian fashion trend embraced styles inspired by Indigenous, African, and Asian cultures, blending them into eclectic looks that rarely credited their origins. A notable modern example is the 2012 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, where a model wore a Native American headdress—a sacred symbol of honor—prompting widespread criticism for reducing it to a costume. Another case is from 2015, when designer Isabel Marant faced backlash for allegedly copying traditional Oaxacan blouse designs from Mexico’s Indigenous communities without permission or recognition.</p>

            <p>Perspectives on cultural appropriation have shifted over time. Early instances were often dismissed as harmless inspiration, but the rise of social media has amplified the voices of affected communities, leading to campaigns like #OwnYourCulture and greater scrutiny of the fashion industry. Today, debates continue between those who see it as cultural appreciation and those who view it as exploitation, reflecting the evolving question of <b>who gets to define a culture</b>. This history sets the stage for analyzing power and accountability in fashion.</p>

        <section class="context-location">
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>Cultural appropriation in fashion spans a range of geographic locations, connecting the indigenous communities where cultural designs originate, the fashion capitals where they are reimagined, and the retail outlets where they are sold to the masses. In places like the Navajo Nation in the United States, Indigenous communities create patterns and textiles rich with cultural meaning, yet these are often borrowed by fashion brands without consent or acknowledgment. These designs then travel to global fashion capitals such as Paris, France, and New York, USA, where designers showcase them on runways, transforming them into high-fashion statements that set worldwide trends. From there, fast-fashion giants like H&M, with stores dotted across the globe, mass-produce and sell these items, distancing them further from their roots. This journey from local origins to global markets highlights how cultural elements are reshaped and spread, often losing their original significance in the process.</p>

        <section class="context-traits">
            <h2>Cultural Traits</h2>
            <p>Cultural traits commonly appropriated in fashion include traditional dress, patterns, textiles, and religious symbols, each deeply tied to the heritage and identity of their originating cultures. The Native American headdress, for example, is a sacred emblem of honor and leadership, yet it’s frequently reduced to a costume or accessory in fashion, disregarding its profound importance. Similarly, African wax prints, which carry West African stories and traditions, and Navajo woven patterns, steeped in Indigenous history, are replicated by brands with little regard for their context or credit to their creators. Religious symbols like the bindi, a South Asian mark of spirituality, are also stripped of meaning when turned into decorative trends. These elements—laden with history, values, and belonging—are often exploited by the fashion industry, raising questions about respect and the ethics of borrowing from cultures without permission or understanding.</p>
